A little about me...
My software engineer journey began (many) years agi when I was a teenager, spending countless hours creating interactive games and whatever else I could code at the time.  After serving in the US Coast Guard I enrolled, and graduated from the Chubb Institute of Technology's Computer Programming curriculum, which ultimately led to my first job as a mainframe software engineer.  Here I would learn the ins and outs of enterprise development in a corporate setting!  After spending nearly 8 years as a software developer, I transitioned into the management/leadership side of Software Quality Engineering.  This is where I would spend most of my career focus... however, the software engineering itch was always present, and the process of implementing clever solutions and providing users with interactive, polished, and engaging experiences was still something I gravitated towards.  Fast forward to 2023 - Seeing the need to update my skillset, and having an opportunity to do so, I explored several software engineering 'Bootcamps' and ultimately landed on (and was accepted) by a top-tier school.  After 14 weeks, and countless (and I am not understating) hours of instruction, howework, study, anxiety, stress and triumph I successully graduated the Fullstack software engineering cirriculum in January 2024!  The software engineeing syllabus focused on modern day languages and frameworks such as Javascript, Node, React, Express, MongoDB, API's, Python, Django, Git, HTML, CSS and SDLC methodologies.  

The journey continues as I expand on what I have learned, and explore other frameworks languages and methodologies!
