A little about me... 

My software engineering journey began (many) years ago when I was a teenager, spending countless hours creating interactive games and whatever else I could develop at the time. After serving in the US Coast Guard, I enrolled and graduated from the Chubb Institute of Technology's Computer Programming curriculum, which ultimately led to my first job as a mainframe software engineer. Here I would learn the ins and outs of enterprise development in a corporate setting. This was a great exposure to the world of professional programming, and it laid the foundation for things to come... After spending nearly 8 years as a software developer, I transitioned into the management/leadership side of Software Quality Engineering. This is where I would spend most of my career focus... however, the software engineering itch was always present, and the process of implementing clever solutions and providing users with interactive, polished, and engaging experiences was still something I gravitated towards. Fast forward to 2023 - Seeing the need to update my skillset, and having an opportunity to do so, I explored several software engineering 'Bootcamps' and ultimately landed on (and was accepted to) a top-tier school. After 14 weeks, and countless (and I am not understating) hours of instruction, homework, study, anxiety, stress, and ultimately triumph, I successfully graduated the Fullstack software engineering curriculum in January 2024! The software engineering syllabus focused on modern-day languages and frameworks such as Javascript, Node, React, Express, MongoDB, API's, Python, Django, Git, HTML, CSS, and SDLC methodologies which provides for an excellent frontend/backend web developer toolbox.

The journey continues as I expand on my professional experiences, my new dev skills, and exploring other frameworks, languages, methodologies, AI and business opportunities!

Cheers! ðŸ˜„
